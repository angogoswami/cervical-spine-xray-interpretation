Skills interpretation by Dr Ananya Goswami :</h1>
<h1 style="font-weight: bold; text-align: center;"> 1.Cervical
Spine X-ray Interpretation</h1>
<p>A lateral cervical spine x-ray is obtained as an initial
trauma series
x-ray. Unstable cervical spine injuries will be detected about 80% of
the time
with this single view. Some unstable injuries are not seen with routine
x-rays,
so spine immobilization is necessary whenever significant force could
have
caused an injury and maintained until complete evaluation after initial
resuscitation. Complete spine immobilization is difficult to obtain and
maintain
during patient movement from cart to car, etc. The lateral cervical
spine x-ray is
useful only because it will detect certain ominous injuries early, with
resulting
concern for rigorous immobilization by the team and involvement of a
neurosurgeon
at an early stage before progression of the injury can occur.<br>
</p>
<p>What to look for on the lateral cervical spine x-ray:</p>
<ol>
  <li>The <span style="font-weight: bold;">prevertebral space</span>
    at the level of C-3 should be less than 5 mm
    in adults.<span style="font-weight: bold;"> PEDS</span>:
    <span style="text-decoration: underline;">This space is
      difficult to interpret in children because it can
      vary widely with swallowing, breathing, and crying. The prevertebral
      space in
      children should not exceed two-thirds of the width of the body of C-2</span>.
    The
    prevertebral space below the larynx should not exceed the width of the
    body of C-6.</li>
</ol>
<h3 style="text-align: center;"><img style="width: 300px; height: 229px;" alt="3_xs_2_A" src=".\\3_xs_2_A.jpg"><br>
</h3>
<ol start="2">
  <li> The <span style="font-weight: bold;">anterior alignment</span>
    of the vertebral bodies. The vertebral bodies
    should form a smooth curve anteriorly; however, degenerative changes
    can make interpretation difficult. Look for bony flecks off of the
    superior
    aspects of the vertebral bodies that signify ligamentous injury. A bone
    chip off of
    the inferior aspect of a vertebral body is called a tear-drop sign and
    is ominous
    for instability and cord injury. Also, carefully note the alignment of
    the odontoid
    process with the body of C-2. Fractures of the shaft of the odontoid
    above the body
    of C-2 are called Type I odontoid fractures and are usually stable.
    Fractures at
    the base of the process (Type II) are unstable and ominous as are
    fractures
    involving both the odontoid process and the body of C-2 (Type III).</li>
</ol>
<h3 style="text-align: center;"><img style="width: 375px; height: 252px;" alt="3_xs_2_B" src=".\\3_xs_2_B.jpg"><br>
</h3>
<ol start="3">
  <li>The<span style="font-weight: bold;"> predental space</span>.
    This space should not exceed 3 mm in adults or
    (<span style="font-weight: bold;">PEDS</span>) <span style="text-decoration: underline;">4 mm in children</span>.
    Increased distance here signifies disruption of the
    transverse ligament that holds the odontoid process against C-1 and may
    accompany fractures of C-1. This is an unstable and ominous injury.</li><br>
  <li>The <span style="font-weight: bold;">posterior alignment</span>
    of the vertebral bodies and<span style="font-weight: bold;">
      intervertebral
      disk spaces</span>. Subluxation of a vertebral body, bony
    fragments, and
    intervertebral disks into the spinal canal are ominous signs. A
    narrowed disk space
    can be a clue that extrusion of a disk into the spinal canal has
    occurred; C-7
    can be subluxed on T-1, so be sure that you can see this junction.
    Obtain a
    swimmer’s view x-ray if this area is not seen on a standard lateral
    x-ray.</li><br>
  <li>The <span style="font-weight: bold;">arch of C-1</span>
    and the <span style="font-weight: bold;">atlanto-occipital
      alignment</span>. Although it may
    be normally incomplete, the arch of C-1 should be carefully examined
    because it can be a clue to the presence of a burst fracture
    (Jefferson’s fracture)
    caused by a blow to the top of the head. This is an unstable injury.
    Atlanto-occipital disruption is almost always immediately fatal, but a
    rare case will
    present still alive. Look for alignment of the clivus with the odontoid
    process.</li>
</ol>
<h3 style="text-align: center;"><img style="width: 400px; height: 304px;" alt="3_xs_2_C" src=".\\3_xs_2_C.jpg"><br>
</h3>
<ol start="6">
  <li>The
    <span style="font-weight: bold;">pedicles, laminae, and
      lateral masse</span>s. The pedicles connect the
    lateral masses to the vertebral bodies; the lamina connect the lateral
    masses
    to the spinous processes. Fractures through these structures can cause
    instability. The hangman’s fracture is a fracture through these
    structures of the C-2
    vertebral body. The lateral masses of the vertebral bodies articulate
    with each
    other at facet joints. If the disk and ligaments between two vertebral
    bodies are
    disrupted, the bodies can rotate on each other to an abnormal degree
    resulting in
    dislocation of one or both facet joints resulting in “locked facets.”
    The alignment of
    the lateral masses should be consistent on x-ray.</li><br>
  <li>The <span style="font-weight: bold;">spinolaminal line</span>.
    Disruption of the spinolaminal line is an
    important indicator of subluxation that might not otherwise be
    apparent. Always
    draw a line from the posterior limit of the spinal canal at C-1 to the
    same
    point of C-3. The same point of C-2 should be within 1 mm of this line.
    If not,
    presume an unstable injury of the odontoid or pedicle fractures of C-2.  </li><br>
  <li><span style="font-weight: bold;">Spinal stenosis</span>. The
    width of the spinal canal on x-ray is normally
    13 mm. Patients with spinal stenosis because of degenerative disease
    are at
    risk of spinalcord injury with minor trauma.</li><br>
  <li><span style="font-weight: bold;"> Spinous
    process angulation</span>. Angulation of the spinous processes of
    11 or more degrees signifies fracture or ligamentous disruption.</li>
